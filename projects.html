We also talked about how the market and economy works, so now I have a clearer understanding about how specific industries can come to impact the economy and market. I've also learned more about finance; it's even become a career option I'm interested in pursuing.”—Kami, Enterprise for Youth intern at VendEx Solutions. Youth Council member Kami had the opportunity to intern at VendEx Solutions through our summer intern program. We are so happy to hear that she had a great learning experience at her internship this summer! And an image of Kami at the podium giving a graduation speech.">
