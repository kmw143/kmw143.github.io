                <h2 class="pageh2">Kami Wang, Student</h2>
                <p> I am a <b>sophomore</b> pursuing a dual degree at Duke Kunshan University and Duke University. I intend to major in Computation and Design, with a track in <b>Digital Media</b>. I am currently based in Kunshan, China and my hometown is San Francisco, California.

                    My interests are in <b>UI/UX</b> design and testing, but I am still learning about this field and am open to exploring other areas! My professional experience includes working as a <b>data analyst</b>, conducting market research, and breaking down contracts. I have also planned events and event outreach for high school students undergoing job training. 
                    
                    Outside of school, I enjoy learning languages, <a href="interests-photography.html">photography</a>, <a href="interests-travel.html">travelling</a>, and writing blogs about <a href="interests-tvfilm.html">TV/film</a> and <a href="interests-music.html">music</a>! I speak a few <b>languages</b> to some extent, including four dialects of Chinese, Korean, and Spanish. I have travelled to all 50 American states and lived in Spain and China during college so far! I also love eating dumplings and sharing my culinary creations with my family and friends. In my free time, I am usually reading Dan Brown's series or watching Asian variety shows, while vibing to KPOP and the band, 5 Seconds of Summer!
                    
                    If you would like to know me better, feel free to reach out and contact me!</p>
