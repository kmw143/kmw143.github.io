                <h2 class="pageh2">Kami Wang, Student</h2>
                <p> I am a sophomore pursuing a dual degree at Duke Kunshan University and Duke University. I intend to major in Computation and Design, with a track in Digital Media. I am currently based in Kunshan, China and my hometown is San Francisco, California.

                    My professional experience includes working as a data analyst, conducting market research, and breaking down contracts. I have also planned events and event outreach for high school students undergoing job training. 
                    
                    Outside of school, I enjoy learning languages, photography, traveling, and writing blogs about TV/film and music! I speak a few languages to some extent, including four dialects of Chinese, Korean, and Spanish. I have travelled to all 50 American states and lived in Spain and China during college so far! I also love eating dumplings and sharing my culinary creations with my family and friends. In my free time, I am usually reading Dan Brown's series or watching Asian variety shows, while vibing to KPOP and the band, 5 Seconds of Summer!
                    
                    If you would like to know me better, feel free to reach out and contact me!</p>
