            <h2>What is DesertRacers?</h2>
            <p>DesertRacers is a single-player kart racing game I created, based off the Unity Learn Karting Microgame, during Mission Bit's Intro to Unity Game Design class. I presented DesertRacers at Mission Bit's Summer 2021 Demo Day and Fifth Annual Gala.</p>
        
            <h2>Why did I make this game?</h2>
            <p>This game was made mostly for people who don’t play video games. It’s called DesertRacers because the environment is decorated like a desert. The objective of the game is to race around a track within 2.5 minutes. There are some speed pads that make you go faster and some difficult turns to slow you down. That’s why I chose 2.5 minutes for the time limit, because it is the perfect difficulty for this game. I got inspiration from the few video games I play, which are mostly racing games, and I wanted to make my own.</p>
        
            <h2>Gameplay Walkthrough</h2>
            <h3>Intro Menu</h3>
            <p>Includes a spinning kart character, access to Controls, and the play button.</p>

            <h2>Creation Process</h2>
            <p>Using the Unity Learn Karting Microgame and the skills I learned from my class, I employed C# and various Unity features over the course of a few weeks to create this game. </p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>I presented this game at Demo Day Summer 2021 and was awarded the Most Innovative Award for demonstrating creativity and embracing experimentation.</p>

            <h2>Goals for the future</h2>
            <p>In the future, I would like to implement a mobile phone controller since using the keyboard controller is a bit sensitive. I also want to develop levels, with new tracks, environments, and difficulties. I hope all the players can enjoy my game!</p>
        
            <h2>Try out the game for yourself!</h2>
