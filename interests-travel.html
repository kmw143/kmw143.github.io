            <h2>Why I Love to Travel</h2>
            <p>When I was younger, I had the priviledge and luxury to travel around the world with my parents. We would often take road trips around the US to visit national parks. Despite the long car rides that I despised, I found every adventure to be a great memory and experience. Since I've started college, I've had many opportunities to travel in Europe and around Asia. Here are a few thoughts I have.</p>
        
            <h2>First Semester of College - Traveling Europe</h2>
            <p>During Fall 2022, I studied in Barcelona. Because of the Spanish/Chinese holidays and proximity to other European cities, I had many opportunities for cheap travel experiences. I traveled to Paris, Milan, Brussels, Cologne, Nice, Monaco, Madrid, and more just within my first 3 months as an adult. My favorite trip was to Nice/Monaco but the most eventful may have been the first trip to Paris and Milan. It was my first time traveling without my family and with a new group of people I'd only met less than a month prior. It was definitely a growing experience but it is one of my most unique and memorable. </p>
        
            <h2>Second Semester of College - Traveling Asia</h2>
            <p>During Spring 2023, my second semester in college, I finally made it to the DKU campus in Kunshan. Because of its proximity to Suzhou and Shanghai, I was able to make quite a few eventful day trips seeing touristy areas. I was also able to travel to Xiamen to visit a friend's family with her. On the way back, I took an 8 hour train across China by myself. During longer breaks, I traveled to Hong Kong and Seoul. I had previously visited these cities and fell in love with them even more the second time around.</p>
        
            <h2>Summer 2023</h2>
            <p>Flights from Shanghai home to San Francisco are not the cheapest and most convenient, you often need to layover in another area. On my way home, I spent a week in Tokyo, Japan with my mom and was reminded how amazing it was to travel and relax at the same time. This remains one of my most memorable travels.</p>

            <h2>Fall 2023</h2>
            <p>This fall, I did not have many opportunities to travel. The biggest trip was a weekend alone in Shanghai to relax. It was my first time traveling completely alone and staying in a hotel by myself. I felt very safe and overall enjoyed this experience.</p>
