            <h2>What is VendEx Solutions?</h2>
            <p>VendEx Solutions is a fintech company founded in 2019. Their mission is to become the centralized marketplace for financial services market data. They offer a suite of products to manage data and fintech vendor relationships, delivered in a fully integrated platform.</p>

            <h2>How did I end up interning at VendEx Solutions?</h2>
            <p>In May 2020, I was matched with VendEx as an intern through Enterprise For Youth, a San Francisco-based organization that helps high schoolers get job training and their first job. I was very fortunate to be trained and managed by someone who I now consider a mentor of mine, Michele Kelsey. She is based near Charleston, South Carolina, while I and a few other colleagues are based in San Francisco. My first internship was a remote one due to the COVID-19 pandemic and I still have yet to meet Michele in person. Hopefully during my study abroad semester at Duke University, I will make the trip to Charleston to visit her and other members of the team.</p>

            <h2>What did I do at VendEx?</h2>
            <h3>VSource</h3>
            <p>During my summer internship, I worked on VSource, a centralized catalog of data and vendor services. This database allows clients to research, monitor, and compare Vendors. My day-to-day consisted of online market research of assigned Vendors. I wrote company and product descriptions, according to the neutral style and requirements of VSource. These contributions are live in the database, with over 2200 products and 340 vendors as of August 2023. In this process, I was also invited to attend weekly company-wide meetings where I learned about professional etiquette and the know-hows of conducting briefings and presentations.</p>
            <h3>VKey</h3>
            <p>In the summers following 2020, I worked on VKey, which maps market data contracts and digitizes contract terms. I initially contributed to document tracking and breakdowns (breaking down document terms and logging them into VKey.) This work required familiarity in Excel, which I gained over time through this experience. Later on, I contributed to the in-progress redesign of VKey. VKey 2.0 set out to improve the "fields", or document terms, that were specified by VKey. I took part in mapping necessary fields and translating them into new VKey requirements. In this process, I participated in product development and design discussions with members of other VendEx teams. I also managed a small intern team to digitize client contracts at this time.</p>

            <h2>What I learned and what I'll take with me going forward</h2>
            <p>Through this experience, I gained invaluable experience and knowledge that I will employ going forward. In terms of hard skills, I now have a better understanding of neutral writing and written communication, Excel, and the finance world. In terms of soft skills, I've improved on my communication, leadership, and advocacy. Most importantly, I've gained lifelong connections and mentors.</p>
