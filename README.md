## Set Up
This repository contains the source code for the site. Each HTML file is a page in the website. There is one CSS file for styling all pages and two JavaScript files for interactive features. The first JavaScript file, nav.js, is used for creating a mobile navigational menu. The second file, resume.js, is used for the About page to create an accordion dropdown. All images and icons used in the project are stored in the img folder. The Monserrat font utilized is stored in the fonts folder. Lastly the downloadable PDF resume is stored in the downloads folder.

In order to use source code and run the website locally, you must download all the files in the repository and open them in a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code. To view the site, local HTML files can be opened in any browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
